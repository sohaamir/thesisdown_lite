# Introduction

_This report summarises the three studies that I plan to run during my PhD, which aims to uncover the neurocomputational mechanisms of social learning and how this is altered in psychopathology_. 

_I firstly provide a detailed account of my initial behavioural study examining transdiagnostic influences on observational and experiential learning, performing a review of the relevant literature before discussing the methods and hypothesised results. Following this, two neuroimaging studies where I aim to uncover the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying social learning in social anxiety, and its treatment using smartphone-delivered CBT, will be briefly outlined_.

_Together, this research will provide a formal account of social learning grounded in computational neuroscience, informing novel methods of psychiatric treatment_.
