            "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dysfunctional expectations of impending social or performance outcomes are core features of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) but often lack formal definition in clinical research. Reinforcement learning (RL) models offer a framework to define changes in outcome expectations in a formal way by computing the prediction error (PE). This study quantifies the updating of expectations by PEs in SAD and investigates alterations in RL regions associated with PE signaling. METHOD 48 adult participants (24 diagnosed with SAD and 24 age-, gender-, and education- matched healthy controls (HC)) underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while learning from probabilistic feedback. Crucially, both groups completed two parallel versions of the task: one in which they learned under scrutiny (social observation) and one in which they learned without being overtly evaluated (non-social control condition). RESULTS Coupling to prediction errors in SAD was elevated in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) when learning under observation. These findings provide the first evidence that PE signaling during social performance situations in SAD is associated with hypersensitive response signatures in DMPFC, a brain region associated with using others’ value standards as a proxy for one’s own value standards. Dynamic Causal Modelling further revealed that RPE-modulated connectivity from ventral pallidum to DMPFC during observation was reduced in SAD. CONCLUSIONS The present results corroborate a crucial role of DMPFC in SAD, which corresponds to dysfunctional expectations about others’ alleged performance standards that play a prominent role in current models of the disorder.",

            "abstract": "Humans learn from their own trial-and-error experience and observing others. However, it remains unknown how brain circuits compute expected values when direct learning and social learning coexist in uncertain environments. Using a multiplayer reward learning paradigm with 185 participants (39 being scanned) in real time, we observed that individuals succumbed to the group when confronted with dissenting information but observing confirming information increased their confidence. Leveraging computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tracked direct valuation through experience and vicarious valuation through observation and their dissociable, but interacting neural representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, respectively. Their functional coupling with the right temporoparietal junction representing instantaneous social information instantiated a hitherto uncharacterized social prediction error, rather than a reward prediction error, in the putamen. These findings suggest that an integrated network involving the brain’s reward hub and social hub supports social influence in human decision-making.",

Computational theories of reinforcement learning play a central role in the newly emerging areas of neuroeconomics and decision neuroscience. In this framework, actions are chosen according to their value functions, which describe how much future reward is expected from each action. Value functions can be adjusted not only through reward and penalty, but also by the animal’s knowledge of its current environment. Studies have revealed that a large proportion of the brain is involved in representing and updating value functions and using them to choose an action. However, how the nature of a behavioral task affects the neural mechanisms of reinforcement learning remains incompletely understood. Future studies should uncover the principles by which different computational elements of reinforcement learning are dynamically coordinated across the entire brain.",

We evaluate evidence from neuroscience supporting the existence of at least partly distinct neuronal substrates contributing to the key computations necessary for the function of these different control systems. We consider the nature of the interactions between these systems and show how these interactions can lead to either adaptive or maladaptive behavioral outcomes. We then review evidence that an additional system guides inference concerning the hidden states of other agents, such as their beliefs, preferences, and intentions, in a social context. We also describe emerging evidence for an arbitration mechanism between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, placing such a mechanism within the broader context of the hierarchical control of behavior.",

In social animals, learning about others is a necessary component of navigating the social world, ultimately contributing to increasing evolutionary fitness. How humans and nonhuman animals represent the internal states and experiences of others has long been a subject of intense interest in the developmental psychology tradition, and, more recently, in studies of learning and decision making involving self and other. In this review, we explore how psychology conceptualizes the process of representing others, and how neuroscience has uncovered correlates of reinforcement learning signals to explore the neural mechanisms underlying social learning from the perspective of representing reward-related information about self and other. In particular, we discuss self-referenced and other-referenced types of reward prediction errors across multiple brain structures that effectively allow reinforcement learning algorithms to mediate social learning. Prediction-based computational principles in the brain may be strikingly conserved between self-referenced and other-referenced information.",

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field’s key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning’s relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson’s wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.",

            "abstract": "Individuals can learn by interacting with the environment and experiencing a difference between predicted and obtained outcomes (prediction error). However, many species also learn by observing the actions and outcomes of others. In contrast to individual learning, observational learning cannot be based on directly experienced outcome prediction errors. Accordingly, the behavioral and neural mechanisms of learning through observation remain elusive. Here we propose that human observational learning can be explained by two previously uncharacterized forms of prediction error, observational action prediction errors (the actual minus the predicted choice of others) and observational outcome prediction errors (the actual minus predicted outcome received by others). In a functional MRI experiment, we found that brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex respectively corresponded to these two distinct observational learning signals.",

            "abstract": "Humans learn about the environment either directly by interacting with it or indirectly by seeking information about it from social sources such as conspecifics. The degree of confidence in the information obtained through either route should determine the impact that it has on adapting and changing behaviour. We examined whether and how behavioural and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources. Trial-wise confidence judgements about non-social and social information sources offered a window into this learning process. Despite matching exactly the statistical features of social and non-social conditions, confidence judgements were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition to subjective reports of confidence, differences were also apparent in the Bayesian estimates of participants’ subjective beliefs. Univariate activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior temporoparietal junction more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources.",

Over the past decade, researchers have begun to combine computational models with neuroimaging to link social computations to the brain. Inspired by approaches from reinforcement learning theory, which describes how decisions are driven by the unexpectedness of outcomes, accounts of the neural basis of prosocial learning, observational learning, mentalizing and impression formation have been developed. Here we provide an introduction for researchers who wish to use these models in their studies. We consider both theoretical and practical issues related to their implementation, with a focus on specific examples from the field.",

            "abstract": "The fear of negative evaluation (FNE) represents a fundamental component of social anxiety and social anxiety disorder (SAD) within modern cognitive-behavioral models (Clark and Wells, 1995, Rapee and Heimberg, 1997). As such, access to comprehensive psychometrics for measures of FNE is an important component of thorough clinical and research efforts. Among the most popular measures of FNE have been variations of the 12-item Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale (Leary, 1983). There are currently three versions of the BFNE based on two psychometric studies (i.e., two 8-item variants and a 12-item variant). There is still substantial debate regarding which of the three alternatives should be used by researchers and clinicians. Normative data for each of the three alternatives are not available across samples of individuals with diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders; moreover, there has been no comparative assessment of responses for such samples. The present investigation was to provide more definitive recommendations about the three alternatives, to provide normative clinical data, and to explore differences in FNE endorsement across anxiety and mood disorders. Clinical participants included 381 individuals (60% women; age M=35.61, SD=12.49) from an established anxiety treatment and research center. Diagnoses included those with a principal diagnosis of SAD (32%), those with a diagnosis of SAD as an additional disorder (24%), those without a diagnosis of SAD (41%), and those with features of SAD (3%). Results of descriptive analyses, factor analyses, analysis of variance, and receiver operating curves demonstrated that the 12-item variant of the BFNE was inferior or comparable to the two 8-item variants. FNE scores were consistently higher among all participants with a diagnosis of SAD (either principal or additional) relative to all other diagnostic groups (p<.05). Accordingly, the current evidence, as well as parsimony and previous research, supports the utility of the 8-item variant that includes only the original straightforwardly worded items from the BFNE. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.",

            "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in resting-state brain alterations in people with social anxiety disorder. However, the evidence has been mixed and contested and further understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder may aid in informing methods to increase diagnostic accuracy and treatment targets. With this systematic review, we aimed to synthesize the findings of the neuroimaging literature on resting-state functional activity and connectivity in social anxiety disorder, and to summarize associations between brain and social anxiety symptoms to further characterize the neurobiology of the disorder. We systematically searched seven databases for empirical research studies. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1611 participants (795 people with social anxiety disorder and 816 controls). Studies involving resting-state seed-based functional connectivity analyses were the most common. Individuals with social anxiety disorder (vs. controls) displayed both higher and lower connectivity between frontal–amygdala and frontal–parietal regions. Frontal regions were the most consistently implicated across other analysis methods, and most associated with social anxiety symptoms. Small sample sizes and variation in the types of analyses used across studies may have contributed to the inconsistencies in the findings of this review. This review provides novel insights into established neurobiological models of social anxiety disorder and provides an update on what is known about the neurobiology of this disorder in the absence of any overt tasks (i.e., resting state). The knowledge gained from this body of research enabled us to also provide recommendations for a more standardized imaging pre-processing approach to examine resting-state brain activity and connectivity that could help advance knowledge in this field. We believe this is warranted to take the next step toward clinical translation in social anxiety disorder that may lead to better treatment outcomes by informing the identification of neurobiological targets for treatment.",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety (SA) was associated with biases in the updating of self-related information. Whether and under which conditions such biases emerge with respect to other-related information remains under-explored. In a pre-registered study, online participants (n = 590) were randomly assigned to one of two structurally identical reversal-learning tasks with social (faces) or non-social (shapes) stimuli. In the initial phase of this task, stimulus-outcome associations were learned by trial and error. Next, in the updating phase of the task, these associations were modified. SA was associated with reduced negative-to-positive updating and enhanced positive-tonegative updating of social, but not non-social, information. The results extend previous studies suggesting that SA is associated not only with biased updating of selfrelated information but also with biased updating of other-related information. This bias is specific to social information and may contribute, along with other information processing biases, to the maintenance of SA.",

            "abstract": "In an ever-changing social world, learning and updating beliefs about others are essential for smooth interpersonal functioning. Social anxiety is a common and burdensome condition involving difficulties in interpersonal functioning. However, the processes governing the learning and updating of beliefs regarding others, processes crucial for these interactions, are poorly understood. In order to address this gap, we used a novel modification of a reversal-learning task. The task consisted of two phases. In the first (learning) phase, participants learned that interactions with certain individuals were associated with negative outcomes and other individuals with positive outcomes. In the second (updating) phase, these associations were reversed. Hence, negative individuals became positive and vice-versa, and participants had to update their initial beliefs. Study 1 (n = 87; undergraduate students) revealed that social anxiety was not associated with biases in learning positive or negative information about others. However, social anxiety was associated with a deficit in positively updating existing negative beliefs. Study 2 (n = 248; Mturk workers) replicated these findings in a representative and demographically diverse sample, controlling for depression severity and age. The current research suggests that social anxiety-related difficulty in the positive updating of negative social information may contribute to the impairment in interpersonal functioning.",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an excessive fear of social evaluation and a persistently negative view of the self. Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.",

            "abstract": "People learn about their self from social information, and recent work suggests that healthy adults show a positive bias for learning self-related information. In contrast, social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by a negative view of the self, yet what causes and maintains this negative self-view is not well understood. Here we employ a novel experimental paradigm and computational model to test the hypothesis that biased social learning regarding self-evaluation and self-feelings represents a core feature that distinguishes adults with SAD from healthy controls. Twenty-one adults with SAD and 35 healthy controls (HC) performed a speech in front of three judges. They subsequently evaluated themselves and received performance feedback from the judges, and then rated how they felt about themselves and the judges. Affective updating (i.e., change in feelings about the self over time, in response to feedback from the judges) was modeled using an adapted Rescorla-Wagner learning model. HC demonstrated a positivity bias in affective updating, which was absent in SAD. Further, self-performance ratings revealed group differences in learning from positive feedback—a difference that endured at an average of 1 year follow up. These findings demonstrate the presence and long-term endurance of positively biased social learning about the self among healthy adults, a bias that is absent or reversed among socially anxious adults.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) emphasize the role of explicit and implicit self-evaluations (SEs) in the etiology and maintenance of this condition. Whereas individuals with SAD consistently report lower explicit SEs as compared with nonanxious individuals, findings concerning implicit SEs are mixed. To gain a more nuanced understanding of the nature of SEs in SAD, we examined explicit and implicit SEs in two significant interpersonal domains: social rank and affiliation. Consistent with cognitive theorizing, we predicted that, compared to nonclinical controls (NCCs), individuals with SAD would exhibit lower explicit and implicit SEs in both domains. Guided by evolutionary theories we also predicted that the differences in SEs between the groups would be greater in the social rank, as compared to the affiliation, domain. Individuals diagnosed with SAD (n = 38) and NCCs) n = 40) performed two variants of the Self Implicit Association Test: one concerning social rank, and the other concerning affiliation. They also rated themselves on social-rank and affiliation traits. We found that, as compared to NCCs, individuals with SAD exhibited lower social-rank and affiliation SEs. Moreover, differences between the groups in social-rank SEs were greater than in affiliation SEs. Importantly, this pattern was evident in implicit SEs, as much as in explicit SEs. Our findings dovetail with evolutionary accounts highlighting the centrality of the social-rank system in SAD, and refine central tenets of cognitive theories of SAD. A multidomain, multimethod approach to the understanding of the self may broaden our conceptualization of SAD and related disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record",

            "abstract": "The term “Pavlovian” bias describes the phenomenon that learning to execute a response to obtain a reward or to inhibit a response to avoid punishment is much easier than learning the reverse. The present study investigated the interplay between this learning bias and individual levels of social anxiety. Since avoidance behavior is a hallmark feature of social anxiety and high levels of social anxiety have been associated with better learning from negative feedback, it is conceivable that the Pavlovian bias is altered in individuals with high social anxiety, with a strong tendency to avoid negative feedback, especially (but not only) in a nogo context. In addition, learning may be modulated by the individual propensity to learn from positive or negative feedback, which can be assessed as a trait-like feature. A sample of 84 healthy university students completed an orthogonalized go/nogo task that decoupled action type (go/nogo) and outcome valence (win/avoid) and a probabilistic selection task based upon which the individual propensity to learn from positive and negative feedback was determined. Self-reported social anxiety and learning propensity were used as predictors in linear mixed-effect model analysis of performance accuracy in the go/nogo task. Results revealed that high socially anxious subjects with a propensity to learn better from negative feedback showed particularly pronounced learning for nogo to avoid while lacking significant learning for nogo to win as well as go to avoid. This result pattern suggests that high levels of social anxiety in concert with negative learning propensity hamper the overcoming of Pavlovian bias in a win context while facilitating response inhibition in an avoidance context. The present data confirm the robust Pavlovian bias in feedback-based learning and add to a growing body of evidence for modulation of feedback learning by individual factors, such as personality traits. Specifically, results show that social anxiety is associated with altered Pavlovian bias, and might suggest that this effect could be driven by altered basal ganglia function primarily affecting the nogo pathway.",

We suggest that, like other complex systems, the self can be modeled as a network composed of nodes (self-beliefs) and connections between them. We describe how self-network organization may vary between individuals and within individuals over time, and highlight the implications of this variation for affective experience. We further articulate how the self-network emerges from dynamic interactions between large-scale brain networks including the default mode network, valuation network, and frontoparietal control network. Finally, we discuss how a network perspective on the self may provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based approaches to affective disorders.",

            "abstract": "The brain’s default mode network has a central role in the processing of information concerning oneself. Dysfunction in this self-referential processing represents a key component of multiple mental health conditions, particularly social anxiety disorder (SAD). This case-control study aimed to clarify alterations to network dynamics present during self-appraisal in SAD participants. A total of 38 adolescents and young adults with SAD and 72 healthy control participants underwent a self-referential processing fMRI task. The task involved two primary conditions of interest: direct self-appraisal (thinking about oneself) and reflected self-appraisal (thinking about how others might think about oneself). Dynamic causal modeling and parametric empirical Bayes were then used to explore differences in the effective connectivity of the default mode network between groups. We observed connectivity differences between SAD and healthy control participants in the reflected self-appraisal but not the direct self-appraisal condition. Specifically, SAD participants exhibited greater excitatory connectivity from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and greater inhibitory connectivity from the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) to MPFC. In contrast, SAD participants exhibited reduced intrinsic connectivity in the absence of task modulation. This was illustrated by reduced excitatory connectivity from the PCC to MPFC and reduced inhibitory connectivity from the IPL to MPFC. As such, participants with SAD showed changes to afferent connections to the MPFC which occurred during both reflected self-appraisal as well as intrinsically. The presence of connectivity differences in reflected and not direct self-appraisal is consistent with the characteristic fear of negative social evaluation that is experienced by people with SAD.",

            "abstract": "The self is experienced differently in depression. It is infused with pervasive low mood, and structured by negative self-related thoughts. The concept of the self has been difficult to define—one of the reasons it is now infrequently an object of enquiry for psychiatry—but findings from functional brain imaging and other neuroscience studies have provided new insights. They have elucidated how the self is supported by complex, hierarchical brain processes. Bodily sensations rise through the spinal cord, brainstem, and subcortical regions through to cortical networks, with the default mode network sitting at the apex, integrating interoceptive signals with information about the extended social environment. We discuss how this forms a “self axis”, and demonstrate how this axis is set awry by depression. Our self-axis model of depression establishes a new perspective on the disorder. It emphasises the multi-level nature of depression, and how impacts made at different explanatory levels influence others along the axis. It suggests that diverse treatments might be effective for depression, from lifestyle interventions to psychotherapies to medications: they target different aspects of the self, but changes at one level of the self axis can affect others along it. Our framework for depression establishes a central role for the self, which might again become a useful focus of investigation.",

            "abstract": "The brain’s default mode network (DMN) has become closely associated with self-referential mental activity, particularly in the resting-state. While the DMN is important for such processes, it has functions other than self-reference, and self-referential processes are supported by regions outside of the DMN. In our study of 88 participants, we examined self-referential and resting-state processes to clarify the extent to which DMN activity was common and distinct between the conditions. Within areas commonly activated by self-reference and rest we sought to identify those that showed additional functional specialization for self-referential processes: these being not only activated by self-reference and rest but also showing increased activity in self-reference versus rest. We examined the neural network properties of the identified “core-self” DMN regions—in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and inferior parietal lobule—using dynamic causal modeling. The optimal model identified was one in which self-related processes were driven via PCC activity and moderated by the regulatory influences of MPFC. We thus confirm the significance of these regions for self-related processes and extend our understanding of their functionally specialized roles.",

            "abstract": "Background and objectives Reinforcement learning biases have been empirically linked to anhedonia in depression and theoretically linked to social anhedonia in social anxiety disorder, but little work has directly assessed how socially anxious individuals learn from social reward and punishment. Methods N = 157 individuals high and low in social anxiety symptoms completed a social probabilistic selection task that involved selecting between pairs of neutral faces with varying probabilities of changing to a happy or angry face. Computational modeling was performed to estimate learning rates. Accuracy in choosing the more rewarding face was also analyzed. Results No significant group differences were found for learning rates. Contrary to hypotheses, participants high in social anxiety showed impaired punishment learning accuracy; they were more accurate at choosing the most rewarding face than they were at avoiding the most punishing face, and their punishment learning accuracy was lower than that of participants low in social anxiety. Secondary analyses found that high (vs. low) social anxiety participants were less accurate at selecting the more rewarding face on more (vs. less) punishing face pairs. Limitations Stimuli were static, White, facial images, which lack important social cues (e.g., movement, sound) and diversity, and participants were largely non-Hispanic, White undergraduates, whose social reinforcement learning may differ from individuals at different developmental stages and those holding more marginalized identities. Conclusions Socially anxious individuals may be less accurate at learning to avoid social punishment, which may maintain negative beliefs through an interpersonal stress generation process.",

            "abstract": "Adaptive social behavior requires learning probabilities of social reward and punishment and updating these probabilities when they change. Given prior research on aberrant reinforcement learning in affective disorders, this study examines how social anxiety affects probabilistic social reinforcement learning and dynamic updating of learned probabilities in a volatile environment. Two hundred and twenty-two online participants completed questionnaires and a computerized ball-catching game with changing probabilities of reward and punishment. Dynamic learning rates were estimated to assess the relative importance ascribed to new information in response to volatility. Mixed-effects regression was used to analyze throw patterns as a function of social anxiety symptoms. Higher social anxiety predicted fewer throws to the previously punishing avatar and different learning rates after certain role changes, suggesting that social anxiety may be characterized by difficulty updating learned social probabilities. Socially anxious individuals may miss the chance to learn that a once-punishing situation no longer poses a threat.",

            "abstract": "Learning and decision-making are modulated by socio-emotional processing and such modulation is implicated in clinically relevant personality traits of social anxiety. The present study elucidates the computational and neural mechanisms by which emotionally aversive cues disrupt learning in socially anxious human individuals. Healthy volunteers with low or high trait social anxiety performed a reversal learning task requiring learning actions in response to angry or happy face cues. Choice data were best captured by a computational model in which learning rate was adjusted according to the history of surprises. High trait socially anxious individuals used a less-dynamic strategy for adjusting their learning rate in trials started with angry face cues and unlike the low social anxiety group, their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity did not covary with the learning rate. Our results demonstrate that trait social anxiety is accompanied by disruption of optimal learning and dACC activity in threatening situations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Social anxiety is known to influence a broad range of cognitive functions. This study tests whether and how social anxiety affects human value-based learning as a function of uncertainty in the learning environment. The findings indicate that, in a threatening context evoked by an angry face, socially anxious individuals fail to benefit from a stable learning environment with highly predictable stimulus–response–outcome associations. Under those circumstances, socially anxious individuals failed to use their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region known to adjust learning rate to environmental uncertainty. These findings open the way to modify neurobiological mechanisms of maladaptive learning in anxiety and depressive disorders.",

            "abstract": "The ability to learn from feedback, especially under social scrutiny, is an essential prerequisite for successful interaction with the environment. Patients suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD) have been proposed to show altered processing of and learning from feedback, especially depending on social context. However, the neural basis and behavioral consequences of altered reinforcement learning in SAD are not clear yet. In the present event-related potentials (ERPs) study, 34 SAD patients and 30 healthy control subjects (HC) performed an adapted version of a probabilistic feedback learning task in two distinct social conditions. In the observation condition, participants were observed by a confederate; in the control condition, they performed the task without being observed. Patients as compared to healthy controls experienced more subjective discomfort under social observation. Moreover, they showed better learning from negative feedback in the control condition, but reduced learning from negative feedback in the observation condition. This effect correlated with reduced differentiation of positive and negative feedback in the time range of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) under high action-feedback contingency. In addition, SAD patients demonstrated increased FRN amplitudes in the first half of the observation condition, in particular to positive feedback. The present results demonstrate that processing of and learning from feedback are altered in SAD, especially under social scrutiny. In particular, it appears that SAD patients do not process positive information adequately on the neural level, which may impair their ability to differentiate between negative and positive outcomes.",

            "abstract": "<p>Instrumental learning paradigms are rarely employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying acquired fear responses in social anxiety. Here, we adapted a probabilistic category learning paradigm to assess information processing biases as a function of the degree of social anxiety traits in a sample of healthy individuals without a diagnosis of social phobia. Participants were presented with three pairs of neutral faces with differing probabilistic accuracy contingencies (A/B: 80/20, C/D: 70/30, E/F: 60/40). Upon making their choice, negative and positive feedback was conveyed using angry and happy faces, respectively. The highly socially anxious group showed a strong tendency to be more accurate at learning the probability contingency associated with the most ambiguous stimulus pair (E/F: 60/40). Moreover, when pairing the most positively reinforced stimulus or the most negatively reinforced stimulus with all the other stimuli in a test phase, the highly socially anxious group avoided the most negatively reinforced stimulus significantly more than the control group. The results are discussed with reference to avoidance learning and hypersensitivity to negative socially evaluative information associated with social anxiety.</p>",

            "abstract": "Background and objectives Fears of negative evaluation characterise social anxiety, and preferential processing of fear-relevant information is implicated in maintaining symptoms. Little is known, however, about the relationship between social anxiety and the process of inferring negative evaluation. The ability to use social information to learn what others think about one, referred to here as self-referential learning, is fundamental for effective social interaction. The aim of this research was to examine whether social anxiety is associated with self-referential learning. Methods 102 Females with either high (n = 52) or low (n = 50) self-reported social anxiety completed a novel probabilistic social learning task. Using trial and error, the task required participants to learn two self-referential rules, “I am liked” and “I am disliked”. Results Participants across the sample were better at learning the positive rule “I am liked” than the negative rule “I am disliked”, β = −6.4, 95% CI [−8.0, −4.7], p < 0.001. This preference for learning positive self-referential information was strongest in the lowest socially anxious and was abolished in the most symptomatic participants. Relative to the low group, the high anxiety group were better at learning they were disliked and worse at learning they were liked, social anxiety by rule interaction β = 3.6; 95% CI [+0.3, +7.0], p = 0.03. Limitations The specificity of the results to self-referential processing requires further research. Conclusions Healthy individuals show a robust preference for learning that they are liked relative to disliked. This positive self-referential bias is reduced in social anxiety in a way that would be expected to exacerbate anxiety symptoms.",

            "abstract": "In the years since it first published, Neuroeconomics: Decision Making and the Brain has become the standard reference and textbook in the burgeoning field of neuroeconomics. The second edition, a nearly complete revision of this landmark book, will set a new standard. This new edition features five sections designed to serve as both classroom-friendly introductions to each of the major subareas in neuroeconomics, and as advanced synopses of all that has been accomplished in the last two decades in this rapidly expanding academic discipline. The first of these sections provides useful introductions to the disciplines of microeconomics, the psychology of judgment and decision, computational neuroscience, and anthropology for scholars and students seeking interdisciplinary breadth. The second section provides an overview of how human and animal preferences are represented in the mammalian nervous systems. Chapters on risk, time preferences, social preferences, emotion, pharmacology, and common neural currencies—each written by leading experts—lay out the foundations of neuroeconomic thought. The third section contains both overview and in-depth chapters on the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, value learning, and value representation. The fourth section, “The Neural Mechanisms for Choice, integrates what is known about the decision-making architecture into state-of-the-art models of how we make choices. The final section embeds these mechanisms in a larger social context, showing how these mechanisms function during social decision-making in both humans and animals. The book provides a historically rich exposition in each of its chapters and emphasizes both the accomplishments and the controversies in the field. A clear explanatory style and a single expository voice characterize all chapters, making core issues in economics, psychology, and neuroscience accessible to scholars from all disciplines. The volume is essential reading for anyone interested in neuroeconomics in particular or decision making in general. Editors and contributing authors are among the acknowledged experts and founders in the field, making this the authoritative reference for neuroeconomics Suitable as an advanced undergraduate or graduate textbook as well as a thorough reference for active researchers Introductory chapters on economics, psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology provide students and scholars from any discipline with the keys to understanding this interdisciplinary field Detailed chapters on subjects that include reinforcement learning, risk, inter-temporal choice, drift-diffusion models, game theory, and prospect theory make this an invaluable reference Published in association with the Society for Neuroeconomics—www.neuroeconomics.org Full-color presentation throughout with numerous carefully selected illustrations to highlight key concepts",

            "abstract": "Neuroeconomics is a rapidly growing new research discipline aimed at describing the neural substrate of decision-making using incentivized decisions introduced in experimental economics. The novel combination of economic decision theory and neuroscience has the potential to better examine the interactions of social, psychological and neural factors with regard to motivational forces that may underlie psychiatric problems. Game theory will provide psychiatry with computationally principled measures of cognitive dysfunction. Given the relatively high heritability of these measures, they may contribute to improving phenotypic definitions of psychiatric conditions. The game-theoretical concepts of optimal behavior will allow description of psychopathology as deviation from optimal functioning. Neuroeconomists have successfully used normative or near-normative models to interpret the function of neurotransmitters; these models have the potential to significantly improve neurotransmitter theories of psychiatric disorders. This paper will review recent evidence from neuroeconomics and psychiatry in support of applying economic concepts such as risk/uncertainty preference, time preference and social preference to psychiatric research to improve diagnostic classification, prevention and therapy.",

This review surveys the recent and productive application of game-theoretic probes (economic games) to mental disorders. Such games typically possess concrete concepts of optimal play, thus providing quantitative ways to track when subjects’ choices match or deviate from optimal. This feature equips economic games with natural classes of control signals that should guide learning and choice in the agents that play them. These signals and their underlying physical correlates in the brain are now being used to generate objective biomarkers that may prove useful for exposing and understanding the neurogenetic basis of normal and pathological human cognition. Thus, game-theoretic probes represent some of the first steps toward producing computationally principled, objective measures of cognitive function and dysfunction useful for the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of mental disorders.",

            "abstract": "By the late 1990s, several converging trends in economics, psychology, and neuroscience had set the stage for the birth of a new scientific field known as “neuroeconomics”. Without the availability of an extensive variety of experimental designs for dealing with individual and social decision-making provided by experimental economics and psychology, many neuroeconomics studies could not have been developed. At the same time, without the significant progress made in neuroscience for grasping and understanding brain functioning, neuroeconomics would have never seen the light of day. The paper is an overview of the main significant advances in the knowledge of brain functioning by neuroscience that have contributed to the emergence of neuroeconomics and its rise over the past two decades. These advances are grouped over three non-independent topics referred to as the “emo-rational” brain, “social” brain, and “computational” brain. For each topic, it emphasizes findings considered as critical to the birth and development of neuroeconomics while highlighting some of prominent questions about which knowledge should be improved by future research. In parallel, it shows that the boundaries between neuroeconomics and several recent sub-fields of cognitive neuroscience, such as affective, social, and more generally, decision neuroscience, are rather porous.",

            "abstract": "Abnormalities in social interaction are a common feature of several psychiatric disorders, aligning with the recent move towards using Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to describe disorders in terms of observable behaviours rather than using specific diagnoses. Neuroeconomic games are an effective measure of social decision-making that can be adapted for use in neuroimaging, allowing investigation of the biological basis for behaviour. This review summarises findings of neuroeconomic gameplay studies in Axis 1 psychiatric disorders and advocates the use of these games as measures of the RDoC Affiliation and Attachment, Reward Responsiveness, Reward Learning and Reward Valuation constructs. Although research on neuroeconomic gameplay is in its infancy, consistencies have been observed across disorders, particularly in terms of impaired integration of social and cognitive information, avoidance of negative social interactions and reduced reward sensitivity, as well as a reduction in activity in brain regions associated with processing and responding to social information.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the roots of prosocial behavior is an interdisciplinary research endeavor that has generated an abundance of empirical data across many disciplines. This review integrates research findings from different fields into a novel theoretical framework that can account for when prosocial behavior is likely to occur. Specifically, we propose that the motivation to cooperate (or not), generated by the reward system in the brain (extending from the striatum to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex), is modulated by two neural networks: a cognitive control system (centered on the lateral prefrontal cortex) that processes extrinsic cooperative incentives, and/or a social cognition system (including the temporo-parietal junction, the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala) that processes trust and/or threat signals. The independent modulatory influence of incentives and trust on the decision to cooperate is substantiated by a growing body of neuroimaging data and reconciles the apparent paradox between economic versus social rationality in the literature, suggesting that we are in fact wired for both. Furthermore, the theoretical framework can account for substantial behavioral heterogeneity in prosocial behavior. Based on the existing data, we postulate that self-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt an economically rational strategy) are more responsive to extrinsic cooperative incentives and therefore rely relatively more on cognitive control to make (un)cooperative decisions, whereas other-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt a socially rational strategy) are more sensitive to trust signals to avoid betrayal and recruit relatively more brain activity in the social cognition system. Several additional hypotheses with respect to the neural roots of social preferences are derived from the model and suggested for future research.",

            "abstract": "Neuroeconomics has further bridged the once disparate fields of economics and psychology. Such convergence is almost exclusively attributable to changes within economics. Neuroeconomics has inspired more change within economics than within psychology because the most important findings in neuroeconomics have posed more of a challenge to the standard economic perspective. Neuro- economics has primarily challenged the standard economic assumption that decision making is a unitary process—a simple matter of integrated and coherent utility maximization—suggesting instead that it is driven by the interaction between automatic and controlled processes. This article reviews neuroeconomic research in three domains of interest to both economists and psychologists: decision making under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social decision making. In addition to reviewing new economic models inspired by this research, we also discuss how neuroeconomics may influence future work in psychology.",

For example, those with SAD can vary in the reported number and types of feared social situations. They may also report areas of concern other than negative evaluation, including fears of displaying physical signs of anxiety or making others uncomfortable. Further, personality features, such as impulsivity and aggression, may represent variations that are particularly relevant to treatment. Finally, among those with SAD, there may be differing levels of functional impairment in the domains of interpersonal relationships, life satisfaction, and occupational attainment. In addition to these important variations, there may be unique presentations of SAD in several understudied populations and contexts. Therefore, this chapter ends with a brief review of SAD in medical settings, among veterans, and in the context of internet usage.",

            "abstract": "Prominent theories suggest that compulsive behaviors, characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, are driven by shared deficits in goal-directed control, which confers vulnerability for developing rigid habits. However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research.",

            "abstract": "Most of our waking time as human beings is spent interacting with other individuals. In order to make good decisions in this social milieu, it is often necessary to make inferences about the internal states, traits and intentions of others. Recently, some progress has been made toward uncovering the neural computations underlying human social decision-making by combining functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of behavior. Modeling of behavioral data allows us to identify the key computations necessary for social decision-making and to determine how these computations are integrated. Furthermore, by correlating these variables against neuroimaging data, it has become possible to elucidate where in the brain various computations are implemented. Here we review the current state of knowledge in the domain of social computational neuroscience. Findings to date have emphasized that social decisions are driven by multiple computations conducted in parallel, and implemented in distinct brain regions. We suggest that further progress is going to depend on identifying how and where such variables get integrated in order to yield a coherent behavioral output.",

            "abstract": "Value-based decision-making is a complex process that requires, at the very least, the deployment of five basic types of computations. First, a representation of the decision problem needs to be constructed. This entails identifying potential courses of action (e.g., to pursue a prey item or not), as well internal states (e.g., the hunger level) and external states (e.g., the threat level). Second, a value needs to be assigned to the different actions under consideration. In order to make sound decisions, these values need to be aligned with the benefits associated with each action. Third, the valuations are compared in order to make a choice. Fourth, after implementing the decision, the brain needs to measure the desirability of the outcomes that follow. Finally, this feedback is used to update the other processes in order to improve the quality of future decisions. These are not rigid categories, but they provide a useful and reasonable decomposition of decision-making into its composite parts.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms that govern human learning and decision making under uncertainty have been the focus of intense behavioral and, more recently, neuroscientific investigation. Substantial progress has been made in building models of the processes involved, and identifying underlying neural mechanisms using simple, two-alternative forced choice decision tasks. However, less attention has been given to how social information influences these processes, and the neural systems that mediate this influence. Here we sought to address these questions by using tasks similar to ones that have been used to study individual decision making behavior, and adding conditions in which participants were given trial-by-trial information about the performance of other individuals (their choices and/or their rewards) simultaneously playing the same tasks. We asked two questions: How does such information about the behavior of others influence performance in otherwise simple decision tasks, and what neural systems mediate this influence? We found that bilateral insula exhibited a parametric relationship to the degree of misalignment of the individual’s performance with those of others in the group. Furthermore, activity in the bilateral insula significantly predicted participants’ subsequent choices to align their behavior with others in the group when they were misaligned either in their choices (independent of success) or their degree of success (independent of specific choices). These findings add to the growing body of empirical data suggesting that the insula participates in an important way in social information processing and decision making.",

            "abstract": "Depression is a complex and heterogeneous disorder whose cause is poorly understood. Theories on the mechanisms of the disease have often focused on either its neurobiology or its cognitive and behavioral manifestations. Recently, studies exploring how depressed patients process reward and punishment have linked these two facets together. It has been suggested that individuals with a dysfunction in a specialized network of brain regions are unable to exploit affective information to guide behavior. Deficits in this ability might predispose such individuals to develop depression, whereas subsequent restoration of this ability—whether through pharmacological or behavioral treatments—might enable recovery from the disorder. Here we review behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational findings relevant to this hypothesis. There is good evidence that depressed patients exhibit abnormal behavioral responses to rewards and punishments and that these tendencies correspond to aberrant function in frontostriatal systems modulated by the monoamine systems. Furthermore, computational studies have generated testable predictions for how these neural signaling and neurochemical abnormalities might contribute to the symptoms of depression. Combining these approaches—as well as molecular and behavioral work in animals—provides great promise for furthering our understanding of this common and debilitating disease.",

As a result, extensive effort has been directed toward characterizing the psychological and biological processes that mediate dysfunctional reward processing in depression. Reward processing can be parsed into sub-components that include motivation, reinforcement learning, and hedonic capacity, which, according to preclinical and neuroimaging evidence, involve partially dissociable brain systems. In line with this, recent findings indicate that behavioral impairments and neural abnormalities in depression vary across distinct reward-related constructs. Ultimately, improved understanding of precise reward-related dysfunctions in depression promises to improve diagnostic and therapeutic efforts in depression.",

In a strong sense, this is the assumption behind computational neuroscience. Computational psychiatry, as a translational arm of computational neuroscience, can also profit from the computational process approach but applied at many levels ranging from low-level neurobiology through characterization of mental states and even up to the level of multiple interacting humans. Here, we review some of the early evidence for why reinforcement learning in its modern versions moves well beyond behaviorist accounts and provides an excellent “computational paradigm” for framing value-dependent decision-making; something that goes awry in a number of psychiatry conditions. We focus in particular on how social exchange between humans can engage reward systems and can be used as a computational device good for parsing subjects into categories that relate in interesting ways to traditional depictions of psychopathology.",

Here we review preliminary findings from this nascent subfield, focusing on observational learning and strategic interactions. We present evidence consistent with the existence of three distinct learning systems that may contribute to social cognition: an observational-reward-learning system involved in updating expectations of future reward based on observing rewards obtained by others, an action-observational learning system involved in learning about the action tendencies of others, and a third system engaged when it is necessary to learn about the hidden mental-states or traits of another. These three systems appear to map onto distinct neuroanatomical substrates, and depend on unique computational signals.",

            "abstract": "To navigate our complex social world, it is crucial to deploy multiple learning strategies, such as learning from directly experiencing action outcomes or from observing other people’s behavior. Despite the prevalence of experiential and observational learning in humans and other social animals, two fundamental questions remain unaddressed: how do people favor one strategy over the other depending on the environment? And how do individuals vary in their strategy use? Here, we describe an arbitration mechanism in which the prediction errors associated with each learning strategy influence their weight over behavior. We designed an online behavioral task to test our computational model, and found that while a substantial proportion of participants relied on the proposed arbitration mechanism, there was some meaningful heterogeneity in how people solved this task. Four other groups were identified: those who used a fixed mixture between the two strategies, those who relied on a single strategy and non-learners with irrelevant strategies. Furthermore, groups were found to differ on key behavioral signatures, and on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, in particular autism traits and anxiety. Together, these results demonstrate how large heterogeneous datasets and computational methods can be leveraged to better characterize individual differences and their relevance to psychopathology.",

            "abstract": "It has long been suggested that human behavior reflects the contributions of multiple systems that cooperate or compete for behavioral control. Here we propose that the brain acts as a “Mixture of Experts” in which different expert systems propose strategies for action. It will be argued that the brain determines which experts should control behavior at any one moment in time by keeping track of the reliability of the predictions within each system, and by allocating control over behavior in a manner that depends on the relative reliabilities across experts. fMRI and neurostimulation studies suggest a specific contribution of the anterior prefrontal cortex in this process. Further, such a mechanism also takes into consideration the complexity of the expert, favoring simpler over more cognitively complex experts. Results from the study of different expert systems in both experiential and social learning domains hint at the possibility that this reliability-based control mechanism is domain general, exerting control over many different expert systems simultaneously in order to produce sophisticated behavior.",

            "abstract": "Learning to avoid harmful consequences can be a costly trial-and-error process. In such situations, social information can be leveraged to improve individual learning outcomes. Here, we investigated how participants used their own experiences and others’ social cues to avoid harm. Participants made repeated choices between harmful and safe options, each with different probabilities of generating shocks, while also seeing the image of a social partner. Some partners made predictive gaze cues towards the harmful choice option while others cued an option at random, and did so using neutral or fearful facial expressions. We tested how learned social information about partner reliability transferred across contexts by letting participants encounter the same partner in multiple trial blocks while facing novel choice options. Participants’ decisions were best explained by a reinforcement learning model that independently learned the probabilities of options being safe and of partners being reliable and combined these combined these estimates to generate choices. Advice from partners making a fearful facial expression influenced participants’ decisions more than advice from partners with neutral expressions. Our results showed that participants made better decisions when facing predictive partners and that they cached and transferred partner reliability estimates into new blocks. Using simulations we show that participants’ transfer of social information into novel contexts is better adapted to variable social environments where social partners may change their cuing strategy or become untrustworthy. Finally, we found no relation between autism questionnaire scores and performance in our task, but do find autism trait related differences in learning rate parameters.",

Participant-level parameters were extracted from included articles, and a conventional meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Subsequently, these parameters were used to simulate choice performance for each participant on benchmarking tasks in a simulation meta-analysis. Models were fitted, parameters were extracted using bayesian model averaging, and differences between patients and control individuals were examined. Overall effect sizes across analytic strategies were inspected.The primary outcomes were estimated reinforcement-learning parameters (learning rate, inverse temperature, reward learning rate, and punishment learning rate).A total of 27 articles were included (3085 participants, 1242 of whom had depression and/or anxiety). In the conventional meta-analysis, patients showed lower inverse temperature than control individuals (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.215; 95% CI, −0.354 to −0.077), although no parameters were common across all studies, limiting the ability to infer differences. In the simulation meta-analysis, patients showed greater punishment learning rates (SMD, 0.107; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.108) and slightly lower reward learning rates (SMD, −0.021; 95% CI, −0.022 to −0.020) relative to control individuals. The simulation meta-analysis showed no meaningful difference in inverse temperature between patients and control individuals (SMD, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.004).The simulation meta-analytic approach introduced in this article for inferring meta-group differences from heterogeneous computational psychiatry studies indicated elevated punishment learning rates in patients compared with control individuals. This difference may promote and uphold negative affective bias symptoms and hence constitute a potential mechanistic treatment target for mood and anxiety disorders.",

            "abstract": "Expectation of reward can be shaped by the observation of actions and expressions of other people in one’s environment. A person’s apparent confidence in the likely reward of an action, for instance, makes qualities of their evidence, not observed directly, socially accessible. This strategy is computationally distinguished from associative learning methods that rely on direct observation, by its use of inference from indirect evidence. In twenty-three healthy human subjects, we isolated effects of first-hand experience, other people’s choices, and the mediating effect of their confidence, on decision-making and neural correlates of value within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Value derived from first-hand experience and other people’s choices (regardless of confidence) were indiscriminately represented across vmPFC. However, value computed from agent choices weighted by their associated confidence was represented with specificity for ventromedial area 10. This pattern corresponds to shifts of connectivity and overlapping cognitive processes along a posterior-anterior vmPFC axis. Task behavior and self-reported self-reliance for decision-making in other social contexts correlated. The tendency to conform in other social contexts corresponded to increased activation in cortical regions previously shown to respond to social conflict in proportion to subsequent conformity (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010). The tendency to self-monitor predicted a selectively enhanced response to accordance with others in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). The findings anatomically decompose vmPFC value representations according to computational requirements and provide biological insight into the social transmission of preference and reassurance gained from the confidence of others. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Decades of research have provided evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) signals the satisfaction we expect from imminent actions. However, we have a surprisingly modest understanding of the organization of value across this substantial and varied region. This study finds that using cues of the reliability of other peoples’ knowledge to enhance expectation of personal success generates value correlates that are anatomically distinct from those concurrently computed from direct, personal experience. This suggests that representation of decision values in vmPFC is suborganized according to the underlying computation, consistent with what we know about the anatomical heterogeneity of the region. These results also provide insight into the observational learning process by which someone else’s confidence can sway and reassure our choices.",

            "abstract": "Two experiments examined the degree to which socially anxious people’s interpersonal concerns reflect doubts about their personal self-presentational efficacy versus a generalized belief that people tend to evaluate others unfavorably. In the first study, subjects imagined how another person would evaluate them after a brief glance, after a 5-min conversation, or after a prolonged interaction. Compared to subjects low in social anxiety, socially anxious subjects thought they would be evaluated more megatively in every condition. In a second study, subjects were asked how a perceiver would evaluate either them or another person after a very brief, short, or long interaction. As before, anxious subjects thought they would be judged less favorably than less anxious subjects regardless of the length of the interaction. Importantly, socially anxious subjects indicated that perceivers would evaluate other people just as negatively, whereas low anxiety subjects thought they personally would be evaluated more positively than most other people. The implications of these findings for the growing literature on adaptive self-illusions is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The defining pathological features of social anxiety disorder primarily concern the social landscape, yet few empirical studies have examined the potentially aberrant behavioral and neural patterns in this population using socially interactive paradigms. We addressed this issue by investigating the behavioral and neural patterns associated with social conformity in patients with social anxiety disorder. We recorded event-related potentials when healthy subjects (n = 19), and patients with social anxiety disorder (n = 20) made attractiveness judgements of unfamiliar others, while at the same time, being exposed to congruent/incongruent peer ratings. Afterwards, participants were asked to rerate the same faces without the presence of peer ratings. When compared with healthy controls, social anxiety disorder patients exhibited more positive attitudes to unfamiliar others and conformed more with peers-higher feedback. These behavioral effects were in parallel with neural responses associated with social conflict in the N400 signal, showing higher conformity to peers-higher feedback compared with peers-lower or peers-agree feedback among social anxiety disorder patients. Our findings provide evidence on the behavioral and neural patterns of social anxiety disorder during social interactions, and support the hypothesis that individuals with social anxiety disorder are more motivated to pursue social acceptance and possibly avoid social rejection.",

            "abstract": "Anxiety is characterized by altered responses under uncertain conditions, but the precise mechanism by which uncertainty changes the behaviour of anxious individuals is unclear. Here we probe the computational basis of learning under uncertainty in healthy individuals and individuals suffering from a mix of mood and anxiety disorders. Participants were asked to choose between four competing slot machines with fluctuating reward and punishment outcomes during safety and stress. We predicted that anxious individuals under stress would learn faster about punishments and exhibit choices that were more affected by those punishments, thus formalizing our predictions as parameters in reinforcement learning accounts of behaviour. Overall, the data suggest that anxious individuals are quicker to update their behaviour in response to negative outcomes (increased punishment learning rates). When treating anxiety, it may therefore be more fruitful to encourage anxious individuals to integrate information over longer horizons when bad things happen, rather than try to blunt their responses to negative outcomes.",

            "abstract": "When making judgments and decisions, people suffering from depression are often faced with opinions and advice from others (e.g., from their therapists) but it is unclear how their psychopathology alters the utilization of such information. This study is the first to examine whether depressed people are more or less susceptible to informational social influence. To this end, we employed the Judge–Advisor-System, which allows for a pure test of how people utilize information from others. We found that depressed participants had significantly higher advice taking values than non-depressed participants, which was mediated by self-esteem. A fine-grained analysis of these group differences revealed that depressed participants were more likely to revise their initial estimates after receiving advice than non-depressed people. Yet, once having decided to revise their estimates, depressed people did not weight advice more heavily. Theoretical implications concerning two qualitatively independent effects of depression on advice taking are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The present study is aimed to investigate the relationship and gender differences between self-esteem and social anxiety in adolescent students. The sample consists of 200 adolescent students (100 males, 100 females) in the age range of 16 to 18 years, taken from various colleges in Bangalore City. Rosenberg Self-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1965) and Social Phobia inventory (Conner K. M. et al., 2000), were applied to access self-esteem and social anxiety of participants. Statistical analysis was done through SPSS, Pearson product-moment correlation co-efficient and independent sample t-test was applied for evaluation of results. Results indicates that self-esteem is negatively correlated with social anxiety in adolescent students. The findings of result also showed the self-esteem scores of the male adolescents is not higher or lower than that of the female adolescents.",

A purposive sample of 150 men and 150 women was drawn from Sargodha city. Urdu translated Social Connectedness Scale-Revised (Fatima, 2014), Urdu Translated Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (Shahid, 2012) and Urdu Translated Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Sardar, 1998), were used to measure social connectedness, social anxiety and self-esteem respectively. Results revealed that self-esteem positively and significantly predicted social connectedness and it significantly negatively predicted social anxiety. Mediation analysis demonstrated that the relationship between self-esteem and social anxiety was fully mediated by social connectedness. Results also revealed that self-esteem and social connectedness were high in women than men while level of social anxiety was found to be higher among men as compared to women. Implications of the research have been discussed.",

            "abstract": "<p>Most human decisions are made among social others, and in what social context the choices are made is known to influence individuals’ decisions. Social influence has been noted as an important factor that may nudge individuals to take more risks (e.g., initiation of substance use), but ironically also help individuals to take safer actions (e.g., successful abstinence). Such bi-directional impacts of social influence hint at the complexity of social information processing. Here, we first review the recent computational approaches that shed light on neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying social influence following basic computations involved in decision-making: valuation, action selection, and learning. We next review the studies on social influence from various fields including neuroeconomics, developmental psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, and highlight three dimensions of determinants—who are the recipients, how the social contexts are presented, and to what domains and processes of decisions the influence is applied—that modulate the extent to which individuals are influenced by others. Throughout the review, we also introduce the brain regions that were suggested as neural instantiations of social influence from a large body of functional neuroimaging studies. Finally, we outline the remaining questions to be addressed in the translational application of computational and cognitive theories of social influence to psychopathology and health.</p>",

            "abstract": "Background Distortions in metacognition—the ability to reflect on and control other cognitive processes—are thought to be characteristic of poor mental health. However, it remains unknown whether such shifts in self-evaluation are due to specific alterations in metacognition and/or a downstream consequence of changes in decision-making processes. Methods Using perceptual decision making as a model system, we employed a computational psychiatry approach to relate parameters governing both decision formation and metacognitive evaluation to self-reported transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in a large general population sample (N = 995). Results Variability in psychopathology was unrelated to either speed or accuracy of decision formation. In contrast, leveraging a dimensional approach, we revealed independent relationships between psychopathology and metacognition: a symptom dimension related to anxiety and depression was associated with lower confidence and heightened metacognitive efficiency, whereas a dimension characterizing compulsive behavior and intrusive thoughts was associated with higher confidence and lower metacognitive efficiency. Furthermore, we obtained a robust double dissociation—whereas psychiatric symptoms predicted changes in metacognition but not decision performance, age predicted changes in decision performance but not metacognition. Conclusions Our findings indicate a specific and pervasive link between metacognition and mental health. Our study bridges a gap between an emerging neuroscience of decision making and an understanding of metacognitive alterations in psychopathology.",

            "abstract": "Recent work suggests that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have a breakdown in the relationship between explicit beliefs (i.e. confidence about states) and updates to behaviour. The precise computations underlying this disconnection are unclear because case-control and transdiagnostic studies yield conflicting results. Here, a large online population sample (N = 437) completed a predictive inference task previously studied in the context of OCD. We tested if confidence, and its relationship to action and environmental evidence, were specifically associated with self-reported OCD symptoms or common to an array of psychiatric phenomena. We then investigated if a transdiagnostic approach would reveal a stronger and more specific match between metacognitive deficits and clinical phenotypes. Consistent with prior case-control work, we found that decreases in action-confidence coupling were associated with OCD symptoms, but also 5/8 of the other clinical phenotypes tested (8/8 with no correction applied). This non-specific pattern was explained by a single transdiagnostic symptom dimension characterized by compulsivity that was linked to inflated confidence and several deficits in utilizing evidence to update confidence. These data highlight the importance of metacognitive deficits for our understanding of compulsivity and underscore how transdiagnostic methods may prove a more powerful alternative over studies examining single disorders.",

            "abstract": "Confidence is suggested to be a key component in psychiatry and manifests at various hierarchical levels, from confidence in a decision (local confidence), to confidence about performance (global confidence), to higher-order traits such as self-beliefs. Most research focuses on local confidence, but global levels may relate more closely to symptoms. Here, using a transdiagnostic framework, we tested the relationships between self-reported psychopathology, local and global confidence, and higher-order self-beliefs in a general population sample (N = 489). We show contrasting relationships between confidence and psychopathology dimensions. An anxious-depression dimension related to local and global underconfidence. By contrast, a compulsive-intrusive-thoughts dimension related to increased overconfidence at both levels, and showed a decoupling between (1) higher-order self-beliefs and (2) local and global task confidence. The strongest predictor of mental health was a self-beliefs dimension. This study examines higher-order confidence in relation to psychiatric symptoms fluctuating in the general population. Critically, psychopathological symptoms show distinct associations with confidence.",

Amir, 1998), a psychometrically sound, theoretically driven, self-report measure. The revised OCI (OCI-R) improves on the parent version in 3 ways: It eliminates the redundant frequency scale, simplifies the scoring of the subscales, and reduces overlap across subscales. The reliability and validity of the OCI-R were examined in 215 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 243 patients with other anxiety disorders, and 677 nonanxious individuals. The OCI-R, which contains 18 items and 6 subscales, has retained excellent psychometric properties. The OCI-R and its subscales differentiated well between individuals with and without OCD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses demonstrated the usefulness of the OCI-R as a diagnostic tool for screening patients with OCD, utilizing empirically derived cutscores.

We became acutely aware of this situation in a research project where we needed to correlate both the presence and severity of a depressive disorder in patients with other parameters such as arousal response during sleep and changes with treatment of the depressive disorder. It was felt that the general depression scales used were insufficient for our purpose and that the more specific scales were also inadequate. These inadequacies related to factors such as the length of a scale or inventory being too long and too time consuming, especially for a patient",

            "abstract": "This article presents evidence for the reliability and construct validity of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Conceptually, apathy is defined as lack of motivation not attributable to diminished level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Operationally, the AES treats apathy as a psychological dimension defined by simultaneous deficits in the overt behavioral, cognitive, and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior. Three versions of the AES (clinician, informant, and self-rated) were evaluated for 123 subjects, ages 53–85, meeting research criteria for right or left hemisphere stroke, probable Alzheimer’s disease, major depression, or well elderly control. Multiple forms of reliability (internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater) were satisfactory. Several types of validity evidence are presented for each version of the scale, including the following: ability of the AES to discriminate between groups according to mean levels of apathy, discriminability of apathy ratings from standard measures of depression and anxiety, convergent validity between the three versions of the scale, and predictive validity measures derived from observing subjects’ play with novelty toys and videogames. Guidelines for the administration of the AES are presented, along with suggestions for potential applications of the scale to clinical and research questions.",

An abbreviated 26-item version of the EAT (EAT-26) is proposed, based on a factor analysis of the original scale (EAT-40). The EAT-26 is highly correlated with the EAT-40 (r = 0·98) and three factors form subscales which are meaningfully related to bulimia, weight, body-image variables and psychological symptoms. Whereas there are no differces between bulimic and restricter anorexia nervosa patients on the total EAT-26 and EAT-40 scores, these groups do indicate significant differences on EAT-26 fractors. Norms for the anorexia nervosa and female comparison subjects are presented for the EAT-26, EAT-40 and the EAT-26 factors. It is concluded that the EAT-26 is a reliable, valid and economical instrument which may be useful as an objective measure of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa.",

The scale was administered to 412 college undergraduates, 248 psychiatric inpatients, and 73 male prison inmates. Exploratory principal components analysis of the items identified six primary factors and three second-order factors. The three second-order factors were labeled Attentional Impulsiveness, Motor Impulsiveness, and Nonplanning Impulsiveness. Two of the three second-order factors identified in the BIS-11 were consistent with those proposed by Barratt (1985), but no cognitive impulsiveness component was identified per se. The results of the present study suggest that the total score of the BIS-11 is an internally consistent measure of impulsiveness and has potential clinical utility for measuring impulsiveness among selected patient and inmate populations.",

However, researchers have overlooked crucial differences between crowdsourcing and traditional recruitment methods that provide unique opportunities and challenges. We show that crowdsourced workers are likely to participate across multiple related experiments and that researchers are overzealous in the exclusion of research participants. We describe how both of these problems can be avoided using advanced interface features that also allow prescreening and longitudinal data collection. Using these techniques can minimize the effects of previously ignored drawbacks and expand the scope of crowdsourcing as a tool for psychological research.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive and comprehensible, this classic text covers the basic and advanced topics essential for using factor analysis as a scientific tool in psychology, education, sociology, and related areas. Emphasizing the usefulness of the techniques, it presents sufficient mathematical background for understanding and applying its use. This includes the theory as well as the empirical evaluations. The overall goal is to show readers how to use factor analysis in their substantive research by highlighting when the differences in mathematical procedures have a major impact on the substantive conclusions, when the differences are not relevant, and when factor analysis might not be the best procedure to use. Although the original version was written years ago, the book maintains its relevance today by providing readers with a thorough understanding of the basic mathematical models so they can easily apply these models to their own research. Readers are presented with a very complete picture of the \"inner workings\" of these methods. The new Introduction highlights the remarkably few changes that the author would make if he were writing the book today. An ideal text for courses on factor analysis or as a supplement for multivariate analysis, structural equation modeling, or advanced quantitative techniques taught in psychology, education, and other social and behavioral sciences, researchers who use these techniques also appreciate this book’s thorough review of the basic models. Prerequisites include a graduate level course on statistics and a basic understanding of algebra. Sections with an asterisk can be skipped entirely if preferred.",

            "abstract": "Transdiagnostic mental health factors measuring anxious-depressive, compulsivity and intrusive thought and social withdrawal symptom dimensions have been identified as useful constructs that relate to a variety of cognitive constructs. However, the factor measurement relies on the administration of hundreds of questionnaire items which is both costly and a burden to participants. Additionally, it is unclear to what extent these factors generalise across datasets. Therefore, this study sought to optimise the measurement as well as assess the stability of these three factors. Using exploratory factor analysis on 209 questionnaire items, we replicated the same three-factor structure across a pooled dataset of n = 4782 participants, as well as within four independent subsets of the data. Using a machine learning approach, we reduced the number of items to 71 while still measuring the factors with high accuracy. We externally validated these factor scores by replicating previously observed associations with behaviour on a metacognition task. Our results support the generalisability of these symptom dimensions and provide a useful approach to optimising their measurement.",

            "abstract": "Confidence and actions are normally tightly interwoven—if I am sure that it is going to rain, I will take an umbrella—therefore, it is difficult to understand their interplay. Stimulated by the ego-dystonic nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where compulsive actions are recognized as disproportionate, we hypothesized that action and confidence might be independently updated during learning. Participants completed a predictive-inference task designed to identify how action and confidence evolve in response to surprising changes in the environment. While OCD patients (like controls) correctly updated their confidence according to changes in the environment, their actions (unlike those of controls) mostly disregarded this knowledge. Therefore, OCD patients develop an accurate, internal model of the environment but fail to use it to guide behavior. Results demonstrated a novel dissociation between confidence and action, suggesting a cognitive architecture whereby confidence estimates can accurately track the statistic of the environment independently from performance.",

            "abstract": "Impulsivity refers to a set of heterogeneous behaviors that are tuned suboptimally along certain temporal dimensions. Impulsive intertemporal choice refers to the tendency to forego a large but delayed reward and to seek an inferior but more immediate reward, whereas impulsive motor responses also result when the subjects fail to suppress inappropriate automatic behaviors. In addition, impulsive actions can be produced when too much emphasis is placed on speed rather than accuracy in a wide range of behaviors, including perceptual decision making. Despite this heterogeneous nature, the prefrontal cortex and its connected areas, such as the basal ganglia, play an important role in gating impulsive actions in a variety of behavioral tasks. Here, we describe key features of computations necessary for optimal decision making and how their failures can lead to impulsive behaviors. We also review the recent findings from neuroimaging and single-neuron recording studies on the neural mechanisms related to impulsive behaviors. Converging approaches in economics, psychology, and neuroscience provide a unique vista for better understanding the nature of behavioral impairments associated with impulsivity.",

            "abstract": "Impaired decision-making is a key-feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we examined task performance in a healthy population consisting of those whose scores indicated high and low impulsivity on several behavioral decision-making tasks reflecting orbitofrontal functioning. The measures included tasks that assess decision-making with and without a learning component and choice flexibility. The results show that subjects high on impulsivity display an overall deficit in their decision-making performance as compared with subjects low on impulsivity. More specifically, subjects with high impulsivity show weaknesses in learning of reward and punishment associations in order to make appropriate decisions (reversal-learning task and Iowa Gambling Task), and impaired adaptation of choice behavior according to changes in stimulus–reward contingencies (reversal-learning task). Simple, non-learning, components of reward- and punishment-based decision-making (Rogers Decision-Making Task) seem to be relatively unaffected. Above all, the results indicate that impulsivity is associated with a decreased ability to alter choice behavior in response to fluctuations in reward contingency. The findings add further evidence to the notion that trait impulsivity is associated with decision-making, a function of the orbitofrontal cortex.",

            "abstract": "It has recently been suggested that parameter estimates of computational models can be used to understand individual differences at the process level. One area of research in which this approach, called computational phenotyping, has taken hold is computational psychiatry. One requirement for successful computational phenotyping is that behavior and parameters are stable over time. Surprisingly, the test–retest reliability of behavior and model parameters remains unknown for most experimental tasks and models. The present study seeks to close this gap by investigating the test–retest reliability of canonical reinforcement learning models in the context of two often-used learning paradigms: a two-armed bandit and a reversal learning task. We tested independent cohorts for the two tasks (N = 69 and N = 47) via an online testing platform with a between-test interval of five weeks. Whereas reliability was high for personality and cognitive measures (with ICCs ranging from .67 to .93), it was generally poor for the parameter estimates of the reinforcement learning models (with ICCs ranging from .02 to .52 for the bandit task and from .01 to .71 for the reversal learning task). Given that simulations indicated that our procedures could detect high test–retest reliability, this suggests that a significant proportion of the variability must be ascribed to the participants themselves. In support of that hypothesis, we show that mood (stress and happiness) can partly explain within-participant variability. Taken together, these results are critical for current practices in computational phenotyping and suggest that individual variability should be taken into account in the future development of the field.",

Despite a rich theoretical background, the mediators of treatment effects remain only partially understood: it has been difficult to precisely delineate the targets psychological interventions engage, and even more difficult to differentiate amongst the targets engaged by different psychological interventions. Here, we outline these issues and discuss a surprisingly understudied approach, namely the study of cognitive and computational tasks to measure psychological treatment targets. Such tasks benefit from substantial advances in cognitive neuroscience over the past two decades, and have excellent face validity. We discuss two candidate tasks for back-translation and conclude with a critical evaluation of potential problems associated with this neuro-cognitive approach.",

We review research across species targeting the neural and computational systems of social learning in both the aversive and appetitive domains. Social learning generally follows the same principles as self-experienced value-based learning, including computations of prediction errors and is implemented in brain circuits activated across task domains together with regions processing social information. We integrate neural and computational perspectives of social learning with an understanding of behaviour of varying complexity, from basic threat avoidance to complex social learning strategies and cultural phenomena.",

According to recent reinforcement learning models, two distinct components are involved: a “critic,” which learns to predict future reward, and an “actor,” which maintains information about the rewarding outcomes of actions to enable better ones to be chosen more frequently. We scanned human participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they engaged in instrumental conditioning. Our results suggest partly dissociable contributions of the ventral and dorsal striatum, with the former corresponding to the critic and the latter corresponding to the actor.",

            "abstract": "Numerous experiments have recently sought to identify neural signals associated with the subjective value (SV) of choice alternatives. Theoretically, SV assessment is an intermediate computational step during decision making, in which alternatives are placed on a common scale to facilitate value-maximizing choice. Here we present a quantitative, coordinate-based meta-analysis of 206 published fMRI studies investigating neural correlates of SV. Our results identify two general patterns of SV-correlated brain responses. In one set of regions, both positive and negative effects of SV on BOLD are reported at above-chance rates across the literature. Areas exhibiting this pattern include anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and posterior striatum, and thalamus. The mixture of positive and negative effects potentially reflects an underlying U-shaped function, indicative of signal related to arousal or salience. In a second set of areas, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior ventral striatum, positive effects predominate. Positive effects in the latter regions are seen both when a decision is confronted and when an outcome is delivered, as well as for both monetary and primary rewards. These regions appear to constitute a “valuation system,” carrying a domain-general SV signal and potentially contributing to value-based decision making.",

One manifestation of this activity that has become an important research tool is spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of fMRI. The identification of correlation patterns in these spontaneous fluctuations has been termed resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) and has the potential to greatly increase the translation of fMRI into clinical care. In this article we review the advantages of the resting state signal for clinical applications including detailed discussion of signal to noise considerations. We include guidelines for performing resting state research on clinical populations, outline the different areas for clinical application, and identify important barriers to be addressed to facilitate the translation of resting state fcMRI into the clinical realm.",

In this review, we consider recent findings regarding emotion and emotion regulation in the context of social anxiety disorder (SAD). We first describe key features of SAD which suggest altered emotional and self-related processing difficulties. Next, we lay the conceptual foundation for a discussion of emotion and emotion regulation and present a common framework for understanding emotion regulation, the process model of emotion regulation. Using the process model, we evaluate the recent empirical literature spanning self-report, observational, behavioral, and physiological methods across five specific families of emotion regulation processes—situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. Next, we examine the empirical evidence behind two psychosocial interventions for SAD: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Throughout, we present suggestions for future directions in the continued examination of emotion and emotion regulation in SAD.",

The similarity between these two patterns of midline cortical activation may reflect a common neural system for explicit and default-mode self-reference, but there is little direct evidence about the similarities and differences between the neural systems that mediate explicit self-reference versus default-mode self-reference during rest. In two experiments, we compared directly the brain regions activated by explicit self-reference during judgments about trait adjectives and by rest conditions relative to a semantic task without self-reference. Explicit self-reference preferentially engaged dorsal MPFC, rest preferentially engaged precuneus, and both self-reference and rest commonly engaged ventral MPFC and PCC. These findings indicate that there are both associations (shared components) and dissociations between the neural systems underlying explicit self-reference and the default mode of brain function.",

            "abstract": "Background Within maintenance models of social anxiety disorder (SAD), a number of cognitive and behavioural factors that drive the persistence of SAD have been proposed. However, these maintenance models do not address how SAD develops, or the origins of the proposed maintaining factors. There are also models of the development of SAD that have been proposed independently from maintenance models. These models highlight multiple factors that contribute risk to the onset of SAD, but do not address how these aetiological factors may lead to the development of the maintaining factors associated with SAD. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify aetiological and maintenance models of SAD. We then united key factors identified in these models and formulated an integrated aetiological and maintenance (IAM) model of SAD. A systematic review of the literature was then conducted on the components of the IAM model. Results A number of aetiological and maintaining factors were identified in models of SAD. These factors could be drawn together into the IAM model. On balance, there is empirical evidence for the association of each of the factors in the IAM model with social anxiety or SAD, providing preliminary support for the model. Limitations There are relationships between components of the IAM model that require empirical attention. Future research will need to continue to test the IAM model. Conclusions The IAM model provides a framework for future investigations into the development and persistence of SAD.",

            "abstract": "An imbalance in the neural motivational system may underlie Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). This study examines social reward and punishment anticipation in SAD, predicting a valence-specific effect: increased striatal activity for punishment avoidance compared to obtaining a reward. Individuals with SAD (n=20) and age, gender, and education case-matched controls (n=20) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During fMRI scanning, participants performed a Social Incentive Delay task to measure the anticipation of social reward and punishment. The left putamen (part of the striatum) showed a valence-specific interaction with group after correcting for medication use and comorbidity. The control group showed a relatively stronger activation for reward vs. punishment trials, compared to the social anxiety group. However, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were not significant, indicating that the effect is driven by a relative difference. A connectivity analysis (Psychophysiological interaction) further revealed a general salience effect: SAD patients showed decreased putamen-ACC connectivity compared to controls for both reward and punishment trials. Together these results suggest that the usual motivational preference for social reward is absent in SAD. In addition, cortical control processes during social incentive anticipation may be disrupted in SAD. These results provide initial evidence for altered striatal involvement in both valence-specific and valence nonspecific processing of social incentives, and stress the relevance of taking motivational processes into account when studying social anxiety.",

SAD patients showed a lack of social-context-dependent variation of feedback processing, while control participants showed an enhancement of brain responses specifically to positive feedback in VS during observation.ConclusionsThe present findings emphasize the importance of social-context processing in SAD by showing that scrutiny prevents appropriate reward-processing-related signatures in response to positive performances in SAD.",

Neural responses during social and non-social reward anticipation and outcomes were examined in individuals with ASD (n = 16), SAD (n = 15) and a control group (n = 19) via functional magnetic resonance imaging. Analyses modeling all three groups revealed increased nucleus accumbens (NAc) activation in SAD relative to ASD during monetary reward anticipation, whereas both the SAD and ASD group demonstrated decreased bilateral NAc activation relative to the control group during social reward anticipation. During reward outcomes, the SAD group did not differ significantly from the other two groups in ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation to either reward type. Analyses comparing only the ASD and SAD groups revealed greater bilateral amygdala activation to social rewards in SAD relative to ASD during both anticipation and outcome phases, and the magnitude of left amygdala hyperactivation in the SAD group during social reward anticipation was significantly correlated with the severity of trait anxiety symptoms. Results suggest reward network dysfunction to both monetary and social rewards in SAD and ASD during reward anticipation and outcomes, but that NAc hypoactivation during monetary reward anticipation differentiates ASD from SAD.",

            "abstract": "Two historically separate lines of research on social versus non-social decision making are converging in a focus on neural value computations. These value signals may reflect neural mechanisms that enable unified control of behaviour across social and non-social contexts.Two competing theoretical accounts propose that neural value computations underlying both types of choice may either be performed by the very same neurons — therefore providing a ’common motivational currency’ for social and non-social information — or that they may involve different, functionally specialized neuronal populations. There is evidence for both accounts, but existing methodical limitations preclude unambiguous support for just one of them.Social versus non-social choices differ in terms of functional connectivity between regions that are involved in representing value signals and other brain areas that specifically encode social-cognitive functions. This suggests that social and non-social choices mainly differ in the information that is used as input for similar neural value computations.Neural value computations and associated patterns of functional connectivity have been documented for social decisions in three distinct classes of situation that differ with respect to the target and the reference frame of valuation. These classes respectively reflect situations in which interactions with other people are rewarding to the agent, situations in which agents assess value vicariously for other people they observe, and situations in which agents behave in line with abstract social principles.Studies in animal models suggest that some of the social neural value signals are also computed in the non-human primate brain but by different neuronal populations than comparable non-social value signals.A few results from clinical and neural intervention studies show that disruptions of some of these value signals can change social decision making, suggesting an important causal role of these signals in the control of behaviour in social contexts.",

            "abstract": "Given that we live in highly complex social environments, many of our most important decisions are made in the context of social interactions. Simple but sophisticated tasks from a branch of experimental economics known as game theory have been used to study social decision-making in the laboratory setting, and a variety of neuroscience methods have been used to probe the underlying neural systems. This approach is informing our knowledge of the neural mechanisms that support decisions about trust, reciprocity, altruism, fairness, revenge, social punishment, social norm conformity, social learning, and competition. Neural systems involved in reward and reinforcement, pain and punishment, mentalizing, delaying gratification, and emotion regulation are commonly recruited for social decisions. This review also highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex in prudent social decision-making, at least when social environments are relatively stable. In addition, recent progress has been made in understanding the neural bases of individual variation in social decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Most behavioural and computational models of decision making assume that the following five processes are carried out at the time the decision is made: representation, action valuation, action selection, outcome valuation, and learning.On the basis of a sizeable body of animal and human behavioural evidence, several groups have proposed the existence of three different types of valuation systems: Pavlovian, habitual and goal-directed systems.Pavlovian systems assign value to only a small set of ’prepared’ behaviours and thus have a limited behavioural repertoire. Nevertheless, they might be the driving force behind behaviours with important economic consequences (for example, overeating). Examples include preparatory behaviours, such as approaching a cue that predicts food, and consummatory behaviours, such as ingesting available food.Habit valuation systems learn to assign values to stimulus–response associations on the basis of previous experience through a process of trial-and-error. Examples of habits include a smoker’s desire to have a cigarette at particular times of day (for example, after a meal) and a rat’s tendency to forage in a cue-dependent location after sufficient training.Goal-directed systems assign values to actions by computing action–outcome associations and then evaluating the rewards that are associated with the different outcomes. An example of a goal-directed behaviour is the decision what to eat at a new restaurant.An important difference between habitual and goal-directed systems has to do with how they respond to changes in the environment. The goal-directed system updates the value of an action as soon as the value of its outcome changes, whereas the habit system only learns with repeated experience.The values computed by the three systems can be modulated by factors such as the risk that is associated with the decision, the time delay to the outcomes, and social considerations.The quality of the decisions made by an animal depend on how its brain assigns control to the different valuation systems in situations in which it has to make a choice between several potential actions that are assigned conflicting values.The learning properties of the habit system seem to be well-described by simple reinforcement algorithms, such as Q-learning. Some of the key computations that are predicted by these models are instantiated in the dopamine system.",

            "abstract": "Value plays a central role in practically every aspect of human life that requires a decision: whether we choose between different consumer goods, whether we decide which person we marry or which political candidate gets our vote, we choose the option that has more value to us. Over the last decade, neuroeconomic research has mapped the neural substrates of economic value, revealing that activation in brain regions such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), ventral striatum or posterior cingulate cortex reflects how much an individual values an option and which of several options he/she will choose. However, while great progress has been made exploring the mechanisms underlying concrete decisions, neuroeconomic research has been less concerned with the questions of why people value what they value, and why different people value different things. Social psychologists and sociologists have long been interested in core values, motivational constructs that are intrinsically linked to the self-schema and are used to guide actions and decisions across different situations and different time points. Core value may thus be an important determinant of individual differences in economic value computation and decision-making. Based on a review of recent neuroimaging studies investigating the neural representation of core values and their interactions with neural systems representing economic value, we outline a common framework that integrates the core value concept and neuroeconomic research on value-based decision-making.",

            "abstract": "The combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational models for a given cognitive process provides a powerful framework for testing hypotheses about the neural computations underlying such processes in the brain. Here, we outline the steps involved in implementing this approach with reference to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) models that can account for human choice behavior during value-based decision making. The model generates internal variables which can be used to construct fMRI predictor variables and regressed against individual subjects’ fMRI data. The resulting regression coefficients reflect the strength of the correlation with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity and the relevant internal variables from the model. In the second part of this review, we describe human neuroimaging studies that have employed this analysis strategy to identify brain regions involved in the computations mediating reward-related decision making.

            "abstract": "Decisions can arise in different ways, such as a gut feeling, doing what worked last time, or planful deliberation. Different decision-making systems are dissociable behaviorally, map onto distinct brain systems, and require different computational demands. For instance, &#8217;model-free&#8217; decision strategies use prediction errors to estimate scalar action values from previous experience, while &#8217;model-based&#8217; strategies leverage internal forward models to generate and evaluate potentially rich outcome expectancies. Animal learning studies indicate that expectancies may arise from different sources, including not only forward models but also Pavlovian associations, and the flexibility with which such representations impact behavior may depend on how they are generated. In the light of these considerations, we review the results of van der Meer and Redish (2009a), who found that ventral striatal neurons that respond to reward delivery can also be activated at other points, notably at a decision point where hippocampal forward representations were also observed. These data suggest the possibility that ventral striatal reward representations contribute to model-based expectancies used in deliberative decision-making.",

            "abstract": "With the development of functional neuroimaging, important progress has been made in identifying the brain regions involved in self-related processing. One of the most consistent findings has been that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) is activated when people contemplate various aspects of themselves and their life, such their traits, experiences, preferences, abilities, and goals. Recent evidence suggests that this region does not support the act of self-reflection per se, but its precise function in self-processing remains unclear. In this article, I examine the hypothesis that the vMPFC may contribute to assign personal value or significance to self-related contents: stimuli and mental representations that refer or relate to the self tend to be assigned unique value or significance, and the function of the vMPFC may precisely be to evaluate or represent such significance. Although relatively few studies to date have directly tested this hypothesis, several lines of evidence converge to suggest that vMPFC activity during self-processing depends on the personal significance of self-related contents. First, increasing psychological distance from self-representations leads to decreased activation in the vMPFC. Second, the magnitude of vMPFC activation increases linearly with the personal importance attributed to self-representations. Third, the activity of the vMPFC is modulated by individual differences in the interest placed on self-reflection. Finally, the evidence shows that the vMPFC responds to outer aspects of self that have high personal value, such as possessions and close others. By assigning personal value to self-related contents, the vMPFC may play an important role in the construction, stabilization, and modification of self-representations, and ultimately in guiding our choices and decisions.",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent and disabling mental health condition, characterized by excessive fear and anxiety in social situations. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms have been increasingly used to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of SAD in the absence of threat-related stimuli. Previous studies have primarily focused on the role of the amygdala in SAD. However, the amygdala consists of functionally and structurally distinct subregions, and recent studies have highlighted the importance of investigating the role of these subregions independently. Using multiband fMRI, we analyzed resting-state data from 135 participants (42 SAD, 93 healthy controls). By employing voxel-wise permutation testing, we examined group differences of fMRI connectivity and associations between fMRI connectivity and social anxiety symptoms to further investigate the classification of SAD as a categorical or dimensional construct. Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity analysis using multiple “seeds” including the amygdala and its subregions and the precuneus, revealed no statistically significant group differences. However, social anxiety severity was significantly negatively correlated with functional connectivity of the precuneus - perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and positively correlated with functional connectivity of the amygdala (specifically the superficial subregion) - parietal/cerebellar areas. Our findings demonstrate clear links between symptomatology and brain connectivity in the absence of diagnostic differences, with evidence of amygdala subregion-specific alterations. The observed brain-symptom associations did not include disturbances in the brain’s fear circuitry (i.e., disturbances in connectivity between amygdala - prefrontal regions) likely due to the absence of threat-related stimuli.",

            "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in resting-state brain alterations in people with social anxiety disorder. However, the evidence has been mixed and contested and further understanding of the neurobiology of this disorder may aid in informing methods to increase diagnostic accuracy and treatment targets. With this systematic review, we aimed to synthesize the findings of the neuroimaging literature on resting-state functional activity and connectivity in social anxiety disorder, and to summarize associations between brain and social anxiety symptoms to further characterize the neurobiology of the disorder. We systematically searched seven databases for empirical research studies. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1611 participants (795 people with social anxiety disorder and 816 controls). Studies involving resting-state seed-based functional connectivity analyses were the most common. Individuals with social anxiety disorder (vs. controls) displayed both higher and lower connectivity between frontal–amygdala and frontal–parietal regions. Frontal regions were the most consistently implicated across other analysis methods, and most associated with social anxiety symptoms. Small sample sizes and variation in the types of analyses used across studies may have contributed to the inconsistencies in the findings of this review. This review provides novel insights into established neurobiological models of social anxiety disorder and provides an update on what is known about the neurobiology of this disorder in the absence of any overt tasks (i.e., resting state). The knowledge gained from this body of research enabled us to also provide recommendations for a more standardized imaging pre-processing approach to examine resting-state brain activity and connectivity that could help advance knowledge in this field. We believe this is warranted to take the next step toward clinical translation in social anxiety disorder that may lead to better treatment outcomes by informing the identification of neurobiological targets for treatment.",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an excessive fear of social evaluation and a persistently negative view of the self. Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.",

            "abstract": "The brain’s default mode network has a central role in the processing of information concerning oneself. Dysfunction in this self-referential processing represents a key component of multiple mental health conditions, particularly social anxiety disorder (SAD). This case-control study aimed to clarify alterations to network dynamics present during self-appraisal in SAD participants. A total of 38 adolescents and young adults with SAD and 72 healthy control participants underwent a self-referential processing fMRI task. The task involved two primary conditions of interest: direct self-appraisal (thinking about oneself) and reflected self-appraisal (thinking about how others might think about oneself). Dynamic causal modeling and parametric empirical Bayes were then used to explore differences in the effective connectivity of the default mode network between groups. We observed connectivity differences between SAD and healthy control participants in the reflected self-appraisal but not the direct self-appraisal condition. Specifically, SAD participants exhibited greater excitatory connectivity from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and greater inhibitory connectivity from the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) to MPFC. In contrast, SAD participants exhibited reduced intrinsic connectivity in the absence of task modulation. This was illustrated by reduced excitatory connectivity from the PCC to MPFC and reduced inhibitory connectivity from the IPL to MPFC. As such, participants with SAD showed changes to afferent connections to the MPFC which occurred during both reflected self-appraisal as well as intrinsically. The presence of connectivity differences in reflected and not direct self-appraisal is consistent with the characteristic fear of negative social evaluation that is experienced by people with SAD.",

            "abstract": "The self is experienced differently in depression. It is infused with pervasive low mood, and structured by negative self-related thoughts. The concept of the self has been difficult to define—one of the reasons it is now infrequently an object of enquiry for psychiatry—but findings from functional brain imaging and other neuroscience studies have provided new insights. They have elucidated how the self is supported by complex, hierarchical brain processes. Bodily sensations rise through the spinal cord, brainstem, and subcortical regions through to cortical networks, with the default mode network sitting at the apex, integrating interoceptive signals with information about the extended social environment. We discuss how this forms a “self axis”, and demonstrate how this axis is set awry by depression. Our self-axis model of depression establishes a new perspective on the disorder. It emphasises the multi-level nature of depression, and how impacts made at different explanatory levels influence others along the axis. It suggests that diverse treatments might be effective for depression, from lifestyle interventions to psychotherapies to medications: they target different aspects of the self, but changes at one level of the self axis can affect others along it. Our framework for depression establishes a central role for the self, which might again become a useful focus of investigation.",

In our study of 88 participants, we examined self-referential and resting-state processes to clarify the extent to which DMN activity was common and distinct between the conditions. Within areas commonly activated by self-reference and rest we sought to identify those that showed additional functional specialization for self-referential processes: these being not only activated by self-reference and rest but also showing increased activity in self-reference versus rest. We examined the neural network properties of the identified “core-self” DMN regions—in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and inferior parietal lobule—using dynamic causal modeling. The optimal model identified was one in which self-related processes were driven via PCC activity and moderated by the regulatory influences of MPFC. We thus confirm the significance of these regions for self-related processes and extend our understanding of their functionally specialized roles.",

We suggest that, like other complex systems, the self can be modeled as a network composed of nodes (self-beliefs) and connections between them. We describe how self-network organization may vary between individuals and within individuals over time, and highlight the implications of this variation for affective experience. We further articulate how the self-network emerges from dynamic interactions between large-scale brain networks including the default mode network, valuation network, and frontoparietal control network. Finally, we discuss how a network perspective on the self may provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based approaches to affective disorders.",

It encompasses both data-driven and theory-driven efforts. Here, recent advances in theory-driven work are reviewed. We argue that the brain is a computational organ. As such, an understanding of the illnesses arising from it will require a computational framework.

We discuss both general and specific challenges for the field, and suggest ways forward.",

One reason may be that it has neglected context and temporal dynamics in the models of certain mental health problems. We develop three heuristics for estimating whether time and context are important to a mental health problem: Is it characterized by a core neurobiological mechanism? Does it follow a straightforward natural trajectory? And is intentional mental content peripheral to the problem? For many problems the answers are no, suggesting that modeling time and context is critical. We review computational psychiatry advances toward this end, including modeling state variation, using domain-specific stimuli, and interpreting differences in context. We discuss complementary network and complex systems approaches. Novel methods and unification with adjacent fields may inspire a new generation of computational psychiatry.",

            "abstract": "Translating progress in neuroscience into clinical benefits for patients with psychiatric disorders is challenging because it involves the brain as the most complex organ and its interaction with a complex environment and condition. Dealing with such complexity requires powerful techniques. Computational neuroscience approach to psychiatry integrates multiple levels and types of simulation, analysis and computation according to the different types of computational models to enhance comprehending, prediction and treatment of psychiatric disorder. This approach comprises two approaches: theory-driven and data-driven. In this review, we focus on recent advances in theory-driven approaches that mathematically and mechanistically examine the relationships between disorder-related changes and behavior at different level of brain organization. We discuss recent progresses in computational neuroscience models that relate to psychiatry and show how principles of neural computational modeling can be employed to explain psychopathology.",

            "abstract": "Improvements in understanding the neurobiological basis of mental illness have unfortunately not translated into major advances in treatment. At this point, it is clear that psychiatric disorders are exceedingly complex and that, in order to account for and leverage this complexity, we need to collect longitudinal data sets from much larger and more diverse samples than is practical using traditional methods. We discuss how smartphone-based research methods have the potential to dramatically advance our understanding of the neuroscience of mental health. This, we expect, will take the form of complementing lab-based hard neuroscience research with dense sampling of cognitive tests, clinical questionnaires, passive data from smartphone sensors, and experience-sampling data as people go about their daily lives. Theory- and data-driven approaches can help make sense of these rich data sets, and the combination of computational tools and the big data that smartphones make possible has great potential value for researchers wishing to understand how aspects of brain function give rise to, or emerge from, states of mental health and illness.",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a debilitating mental health condition characterized by intense fear of social situations that can significantly impair daily life if left untreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, but many patients experience slow progress, possibly due to the heterogeneity of cognitive dysfunction contributing to the maintenance of the disease that is not adequately reflected in a typical one-size-fits-all CBT approach. In addition, many patients only seek treatment late, because human therapists can themselves constitute phobic stimuli. To address these challenges, we developed Alena, a digital CBT program based on the Clark and Wells model of social anxiety (Clark and Wells, 1995) that was reorganized to target the four key cognitive functions associated with the maintenance of social anxiety disorder in separate therapy modules: negative beliefs, self-directed attention, rumination, and avoidance behaviors. Here, we tested the safety, acceptability and efficacy of this therapy program. In a randomized controlled trial, primary outcomes showed the app to be safe and acceptable. Secondary endpoint analyses showed that SPIN scores were significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the control group, and a larger number of participants who completed the four-week digital CBT program showed a reliable reduction in their social anxiety scores compared to a waitlist control group. Our findings suggest that targeted digital CBT without therapist involvement was safe, acceptable and showed promising signs of rapid efficacy in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.",

Ss were required to make structural (Small letters?), semantic (Means same as a given word?), and self-referent (Describes you?) ratings on depressed- and nondepressed-content personal adjectives. Ratings were followed immediately by an incidental recall period in which Ss recalled as many of the adjectives as possible. In accord with predictions generated from a self-as-schema model, adjective recall was greater for the self-referent rating task, relative to the other tasks. Furthermore, consistent with the content-specificity component of this model, both normal and nondepressed psychiatric controls displayed superior recall only for self-referenced, nondepressed-content adjectives. Also, depressives displayed significantly enhanced recall only for depressed-content adjectives rated under the self-referent task. Results support the proposal of A. T. Beck et al (1979) that an efficient negative self-schema exists, specific to the disorder of depression. (24 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by negative self-beliefs and altered brain activation in the default-mode network (DMN). However, the extent to which there is neurocognitive heterogeneity in SAD remains unclear. We had two independent samples of patients perform a self-referential encoding task and complete self-reports of childhood maltreatment, subjective well-being, and emotion regulation. In the replication sample, we also measured DMN activation using functional MRI. We used k-means clustering, which revealed two distinct subgroups of patients with SAD in the discovery sample. Cluster 1 demonstrated higher levels of negative self-referential trait endorsement, lower levels of positive self-referential trait endorsement, and significantly higher levels of childhood emotional maltreatment, lower subjective well-being, and altered emotion-regulation-strategy use. A similar pattern was observed in the replication sample, which further demonstrated higher DMN activation during negative trait judgments in Cluster 1. Participants in the SAD clusters, from both the discovery and replication samples, were significantly distinct from samples of control participants. These findings reveal neurocognitive heterogeneity in SAD and its relationship to emotional maltreatment.",

The strong emphasis placed on the self in these models and related empirical research has also been reflected in evidence-based treatments for the disorder. This systematic review provides an overview of the empirical literature investigating the role of self-related constructs (e.g., self-beliefs, self-images, self-focused attention) proposed in cognitive models of SAD, before examining how these constructs are modified during and following CBT for SAD. Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Guided by Stopa’s (2009a, b) model of self, most studies examined change in self-related content, followed by change in self-related processing. No study examined change in self-structure. Pre- to post-treatment reductions were observed in self-related thoughts and beliefs, self-esteem, self-schema, self-focused attention, and self-evaluation. Change in self-related constructs predicted and/or mediated social anxiety reduction, however relatively few studies examined this. Papers were limited by small sample sizes, failure to control for depression symptoms, lack of waitlist, and some measurement concerns. Future research directions are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning.Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.55 [95% CI, −0.64 to −0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, −0.67 [95% CI, −0.76 to −0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, −0.30 [95% CI, −0.37 to −0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39 [small to medium effect[ [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65]), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care.Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of 12-month and lifetime prevalence and of lifetime morbid risk (LMR) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) anxiety and mood disorders are presented based on US epidemiological surveys among people aged 13+. The presentation is designed for use in the upcoming DSM-5 manual to provide more coherent estimates than would otherwise be available. Prevalence estimates are presented for the age groups proposed by DSM-5 workgroups as the most useful to consider for policy planning purposes. The LMR/12-month prevalence estimates ranked by frequency are as follows: major depressive episode: 29.9%/8.6%; specific phobia: 18.4/12.1%; social phobia: 13.0/7.4%; post-traumatic stress disorder: 10.1/3.7%; generalized anxiety disorder: 9.0/2.0%; separation anxiety disorder: 8.7/1.2%; panic disorder: 6.8%/2.4%; bipolar disorder: 4.1/1.8%; agoraphobia: 3.7/1.7%; obsessive-compulsive disorder: 2.7/1.2. Four broad patterns of results are most noteworthy: first, that the most common (lifetime prevalence/morbid risk) lifetime anxiety-mood disorders in the United States are major depression (16.6/29.9%), specific phobia (15.6/18.4%), and social phobia (10.7/13.0%) and the least common are agoraphobia (2.5/3.7%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2.3/2.7%); second, that the anxiety-mood disorders with the earlier median ages-of-onset are phobias and separation anxiety disorder (ages 15–17) and those with the latest are panic disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (ages 23–30); third, that LMR is considerably higher than lifetime prevalence for most anxiety-mood disorders, although the magnitude of this difference is much higher for disorders with later than earlier ages-of-onset; and fourth, that the ratio of 12-month to lifetime prevalence, roughly characterizing persistence, varies meaningfully in ways consistent with independent evidence about differential persistence of these disorders.

The disorder in adulthood rarely presents in its “pure” form and 70–80% of patients have at least one other psychiatric disorder, most commonly depression. Social anxiety disorder is a risk factor for the development of depression and alcohol/substance use or dependence, especially in cases with an early onset (< 15 years). Individuals with social anxiety disorder have significant functional impairment, notably in the areas of initiation and maintenance of social/romantic relationships and educational and work achievement. The economic consequences of social anxiety disorder are considerable, with a high level of diminished work productivity, unemployment and an increased utilisation of medical services amongst sufferers. Effective treatment of social anxiety disorder would improve its course and its health and economic consequences.",

Median age of onset is much earlier for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) disorders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30 years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14 years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are mostly of comorbid conditions, with estimated lifetime risk of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%) only slightly higher than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime prevalence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways among sociodemographic subgroups.About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder sometime in their life, with first onset usually in childhood or adolescence.

            "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is among the most frequently observed psychiatric disorders, with estimates of approximately 10% of people likely to suffer from the disorder during their lifetime. However, despite causing significant impairment of normal functioning, this disorder is often mistaken as shyness and remains under-recognized and under-treated. Following onset in adolescence, patients with generalized SAD often experience a lifelong and unremitting mental disorder characterized by severe anxiety and disability. Typical duration of the illness is far in excess of that seen in panic disorder, and prospective, long-term, naturalistic studies have indicated that only one-third of individuals attain remission from SAD within 8 years, compared with over two-thirds of those with panic disorder. Comorbidity of other anxiety disorders, depression and personality disorders are common in SAD and associated with more pronounced impairment and a poorer long-term outcome. Effective treatment for SAD is available but use is low and may remain suboptimal, despite the development of pharmacotherapeutic agents with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties and the efficacy of psychotherapeutic approaches. Increased knowledge of the course of SAD highlights the need to examine the role of available treatments, administered individually or in combination, as acute, continuation or maintenance therapy to maximize the chances of remission and long-term benefit for patients.",

            "abstract": "Objective: Although social phobia is common, treatment remains low. In order to gauge public health implications of this low treatment, information is needed on the impairments caused by social phobia. Method: A computer literature review searched for the terms “social anxiety disorder” and “social phobia” in the MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases. New analyses were carried out in the US National Comorbidity Survey. Results: The literature shows that social phobia has serious effects on role functioning and quality of life. These effects are least severe for pure non-generalized social phobia and most severe for comorbid generalized social phobia with avoidant personality disorder. The most direct impairments involve social interactions and information processing errors in these interactions. Indirect effects are even more important. Three indirect effects are highlighted: effects on secondary mental (e.g. depression), substance (e.g. alcoholism) and physical (e.g. cardiovascular disease) disorders; effects on normative role transitions (e.g. educational attainment); and effects on help-seeking. Conclusion: Given the early age of onset and impacts on secondary disorders and early adult life course transitions, the greatest public health impact of increasing treatment of social phobia is likely to be achieved by developing programs targeted at early identification and treatment through schools.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness in Europe, with a 12-month prevalence of 14% among persons aged 14 to 65. Their onset is usually in adolescence or early adulthood. The affected patients often develop further mental or somatic illnesses (sequential comorbidity). METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. RESULTS: The group of anxiety disorders includes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobic disorders, panic disorders, and two disorders that are often restricted to childhood-separation anxiety and selective mutism. A comprehensive differential diag- nostic evaluation is essential, because anxiety can be a principal manifestation of other types of mental or somatic illness as well. Psychotherapy and treatment with psychoactive drugs are the therapeutic strategies of first choice. Of all types of psycho- therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy has the best documented efficacy. Modern antidepressants are the drugs of first choice for the treatment of panic disorders, agoraphobia, social phobia, and GAS; pregabalin is a further drug of first choice for GAS. CONCLUSION: In general, anxiety disorders can now be effectively treated. Patients should be informed of the therapeutic options and should be involved in treatment planning. Current research efforts are centered on individualized and therefore, it is hoped, even more effective treatment approaches than are available at present.",

During cognitive reappraisal trials, compared with wait list, CBT produced (3) greater reduction in negative emotion ratings, (4) greater blood oxygen level–dependent signal magnitude in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, (5) earlier temporal onset of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity, and (6) greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex–amygdala inverse functional connectivity.Modulation of cognitive reappraisal–related brain responses, timing, and functional connectivity may be important brain changes that contribute to the effectiveness of CBT for social anxiety.

            "abstract": "Brain imaging studies over two decades have delineated the neural circuitry of anxiety and related disorders, particularly regions involved in fear processing and in obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The neural circuitry of fear processing involves the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and insular cortex, while cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry plays a key role in obsessive-compulsive disorder. More recently, neuroimaging studies have examined how psychotherapy for anxiety and related disorders impacts on these neural circuits. Here we conduct a systematic review of the findings of such work, which yielded 19 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies examining the neural bases of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in 509 patients with anxiety and related disorders. We conclude that, although each of these related disorders is mediated by somewhat different neural circuitry, CBT may act in a similar way to increase prefrontal control of subcortical structures. These findings are consistent with an emphasis in cognitive-affective neuroscience on the potential therapeutic value of enhancing emotional regulation in various psychiatric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is “gold standard” psychotherapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Cognitive models posit that preferential processing of threat mediates excessive forms of anxiety, which is supported by exaggerated amygdala, insula, and cortical reactivity to threatening socio-emotional signals in SAD. However, little is known about neural predictors of CBT success or the mechanisms by which CBT exerts its therapeutic effects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during responses to social signals of threat (fearful/angry faces) against positive signals (happy faces) in 14 patients with SAD before and after 12weeks of CBT. For comparison, 14 healthy control (HC) participants also underwent two fMRI scans, 12weeks apart. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses showed therapeutic success was predicted by enhanced pre-treatment activation to threatening faces in higher-order visual (superior and middle temporal gyrus), cognitive, and emotion processing areas (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Moreover, a group by time interaction was revealed in prefrontal regions (dorsomedial, medial gyrus) and insula. The interaction was driven by relatively greater activity during threat processing in SAD, which significantly reduced after CBT but did not significantly predict response to CBT. Therefore, pre-treatment cortical hyperactivity to social threat signals may serve as a prognostic indicator of CBT success in SAD. Collectively, CBT-related brain changes involved a reduction in activity in insula, prefrontal, and extrastriate regions. Results are consistent with cognitive models, which associate decreases in threat processing bias with recovery.",

However, no study has compared the effects of CBGT and MBSR on brain and negative emotion indicators of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance in patients with SAD.To investigate the effects of CBGT and MBSR on reappraisal and acceptance in patients with SAD and to test whether treatment-associated brain changes are associated with social anxiety symptoms 1 year posttreatment.In this randomized clinical trial, a total of 108 unmedicated adults diagnosed with generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBGT, MBSR, or waitlist. The final sample included 31 patients receiving CBGT, 32 patients receiving MBSR, and 32 waitlist patients. Data were collected at the psychology department at Stanford University from September 2012 to December 2014. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to December 2020.CBGT and MBSR.Changes in self-reported negative emotion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal within an a priori–defined brain search region mask derived from a meta-analysis of cognitive reappraisal and attention regulation 1 year posttreatment.Of 108 participants, 60 (56%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 32.7 (8.0) years. Self-reported race and ethnicity data were collected to inform the generalizability of the study to the wider population and to satisfy the requirements of the National Institutes of Health. From the categories provided by the National Institutes of Health, 47 participants selected White (43.5%), 42 selected Asian (38.9%) 10 selected Latinx (9.3%), 1 selected Black (1%), 1 selected Native American (1%), and 7 selected more than 1 race (6.5%). CBGT and MBSR were associated with a significant decrease in negative emotion (partial η2 range, 0.38 to 0.53) with no significant between-group differences when reacting (β, −0.04; SE, 0.09; 95% CI, −0.11 to 0.08; t92 = −0.37; P = .71), reappraising (β, −0.15; SE, 0.09; 95% CI, −0.32 to 0.03; t92 = −1.67; P = .10), or accepting (β, −0.05; SE, 0.08; 95% CI, −0.20 to 0.11; t92 = −0.59; P = .56). There was a significant increase in BOLD percentage signal change in cognitive and attention-regulation regions when reappraising (CBGT = 0.031; MBSR = 0.037) and accepting (CBGT = 0.012; MBSR = 0.077) negative self-beliefs. CBGT and MBSR did not differ in decreased negative emotion and increased reappraisal and acceptance BOLD responses. Reappraisal-associated MBSR (vs CBGT) negative emotions and CBGT (vs MBSR) brain responses were associated with social anxiety symptoms 1 year posttreatment.The results of this study suggest that CBGT and MBSR may be effective treatments with long-term benefits for patients with SAD that recruit cognitive and attention-regulation brain networks. Despite contrasting models of therapeutic change, CBT and MBSR may both enhance reappraisal and acceptance emotion regulation strategies.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02036658",

            "abstract": "One of the puzzles surrounding social phobia is that patients with this problem are often exposed to phobic situations without showing a marked reduction in their fears. It is possible that individuals with social phobia engage in behaviors in the feared situation that are intended to avert feared catastrophes but that also prevent disconfirmation of their fears. This hypothesis was tested in a single case series of eight socially phobic patients. All patients received one session of exposure alone and one session of exposure plus decrease in “safety” behaviors in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Exposure plus decreased safety behaviors was significantly better than exposure alone in reducing within-situation anxiety and belief in the feared catastrophe. Other factors that may moderate exposure effects are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has long been suggested that human behavior reflects the contributions of multiple systems that cooperate or compete for behavioral control. Here we propose that the brain acts as a “Mixture of Experts” in which different expert systems propose strategies for action. It will be argued that the brain determines which experts should control behavior at any one moment in time by keeping track of the reliability of the predictions within each system, and by allocating control over behavior in a manner that depends on the relative reliabilities across experts. fMRI and neurostimulation studies suggest a specific contribution of the anterior prefrontal cortex in this process. Further, such a mechanism also takes into consideration the complexity of the expert, favoring simpler over more cognitively complex experts. Results from the study of different expert systems in both experiential and social learning domains hint at the possibility that this reliability-based control mechanism is domain general, exerting control over many different expert systems simultaneously in order to produce sophisticated behavior.",
